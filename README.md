# MiniDB

MiniDB is a lightweight database management system built in C++, providing record and table management with persistent binary storage. It features a SQL-like command-line interface (CLI), with expanded command support currently in development.

## Features
- Custom table/record system with insert, select, update, and delete operations  
- Binary serialization for efficient persistent storage  
- Low-level file I/O with manual parsing (no external database libraries)  
- SQL-like CLI for basic interaction  

## Roadmap
- Expand CLI with additional SQL-like commands
- Add filtering and expression evaluation  
- Support indexes and query optimizations
